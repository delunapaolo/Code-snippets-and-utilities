This repository contains utility functions and some snippets of code that I wrote or collected. The repo is public for others to take and improve.

Functions, marked by _**F(x)**_, do not usually have any internal dependency. This means that you can simply copy the file containing it and use it in your work.

# python
## console
**[ask](python/console/ask.py)** _**F(x)**_ Function to request user input from console, suggesting possible answers, and with answer data-type validation.

**[numpy](python/console/numpy.py)** Commands to improve printing of numpy arrays.

**[pandas](python/console/pandas.py)** Commands to improve printing of pandas DataFrames.


## I/O operations
**[matlab_file](python/IO_operations/matlab_file.py)** _**F(x)**_ Function to load MATLAB file containing structures.

## pyQt 5
**[Qt_window](python/pyQt/Qt_window.py)** _**F(x)**_ Subclasses QMainWindow to react to window resizing. Also, the window cannot be closed by (accidentally) clicking the close button, because of a boolean flag that has to be turned on to allow this to happen.
