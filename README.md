This repository contains utility functions and some snippets of code that I wrote or collected. The repo is public for others to take and improve. Functions, marked by the icon ![fx](_icons/fx.png), do not usually have any internal dependency. This means that you can simply copy the file containing it and use it in your work.


# python
## console
__[ask](python/console/ask.py)__ ![fx](_icons/fx.png) Function to request user input from console, suggesting possible answers, and with answer data-type validation.

## pyQt 5
__[QtWindow](python/pyQt/QtWindow.py)__ ![fx](_icons/fx.png) Subclasses QMainWindow to react to window resizing. Also, the window cannot be closed by (accidentally) clicking the close button, because of a boolean flag that has to be turned on to allow this to happen.
