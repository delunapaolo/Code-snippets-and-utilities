This repository contains utility functions and some snippets of code that I wrote or collected. The repo is public for others to take and improve.

Functions, marked by _**F(x)**_, do not usually have any internal dependency. This means that you can simply copy the file containing it and use it in your work.

# python
## console
**[ask](python/console/ask.py)** _**F(x)**_ Function to request user input from console, suggesting possible answers, and with answer data-type validation.

## pyQt 5
**[Qt_window](python/pyQt/Qt_window.py)** _**F(x)**_ Subclasses QMainWindow to react to window resizing. Also, the window cannot be closed by (accidentally) clicking the close button, because of a boolean flag that has to be turned on to allow this to happen.
