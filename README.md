This repository contains utility functions and some snippets of code that I wrote or collected. The repo is public for others to take and improve.

Functions, marked by _**F(x)**_, do not usually have any dependency on other files in this repository. This means that you can simply copy the file containing it and use it in your work (if all other external dependencies are satisfied). Functions marked by _**G(x)**_, instead, need other functions in this repository to work correctly. Dependencies are indicated in the file itself. Code snippets are not marked.


# python
## console
**[ask](python/console/ask.py)** _**F(x)**_ Function to request user input from console, suggesting possible answers, and with answer data-type validation.

**[numpy](python/console/numpy.py)** Commands to improve printing of numpy arrays.

**[pandas](python/console/pandas.py)** Commands to improve printing of pandas DataFrames.


## I/O operations
**[matlab_file](python/IO_operations/matlab_file.py)** _**F(x)**_ Function to load MATLAB file containing structures.

## pyQt 5
**[Qt_window](python/pyQt/Qt_window.py)** _**F(x)**_ Subclasses QMainWindow to react to window resizing. Also, the window cannot be closed by (accidentally) clicking the close button, because of a boolean flag that has to be turned on to allow this to happen.
